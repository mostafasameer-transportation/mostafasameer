Hi! My name is Mostafa Sameer and I am from Bangladesh. I have completed my bachelors in Civil engineering from one of the best engineering schools in our country. My CGPA was 3.158 out of 4.00 in my undergrad and my Masters in Business Administration was 2.99 out of 4.00. My major was in Transportation Engineering in my Undergrad (2016). 

 

As our Undergrad thesis I've worked on analyzing the trip attraction rate of hospitals having various capacities in our capital city. In a city, where traffic jams waste around 5 million working hours every single day, emergency vehicles like Ambulances are also trapped in this gridlock often resulting in the loss of life. I also presented my work in International Conference on Quality for Sustainable Development (ICQSD) back in 2016. https://sites.google.com/site/mostafasameeraustprofile/home.  

 

Beside, I have worked on Two Conference Papers in Geotechnical Engineering during my Undergraduate Level back then in 2016 and successfully published it at local conferences.  You can find it in my Researchgate Website in the following link:

Currently, I have been working as a Civil Engineer at KDS Textile Mills Ltd. (Unit - 02) looking after Industrial construction projects of 7 Storied Industrial Building, 3 storied Utility, Generator Substation Building and also a Single Effluent Treatment Plant.
